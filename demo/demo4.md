# A manifesto (of sorts)
Oh hey look, another Tufte ripoff! Anyways,
Typesetting bla bla bla.^[People think you're really smart when you write really
long footnotes. $$\int x \dl{x} = \frac{x^2}{2} + C \,.$$]

For most people, that works perfectly, but typesetters are not so lucky.^[Oh
wow, another sidenote for you to read. Man, I love to read sidenotes---they're
so much fun to read, and I sure love writing them too. Hey, do I look smart?
Do my sidenotes make me smart? It's widely believed that the number and length
of sidenotes are perfectly correlated to the writer's intelligence and/or
attractiveness (Dude, Trust, Me, *et al.* 2024).]
Typography's beauty doesn't derive from process, message, or raw 
aesthetics---it is instead from how easy a document can be read, and 
whether or not the style matches the medium and purpose. If I were to 
print a document, with *massive* comic sans, on printer paper that says 
"***DO YOU'RE BEST :))))***," and handed it out to everyone in my 
neighborhood, people would find it ridiculous; if I were to print that in 
Garamond, and place it in a book a thousand times *a-la The Shining*, 
people would think I'm a serial killer. If I put it on a poster, in bright 
Frutiger or Helveitca, give it some contrasting colors, and hang it up in 
some bar in a gentrified part of New York or Philadelphia---and maybe throw
in a picture of an possum---people would call it graphic design---if I'm 
lucky, they'd call it art.

# Modern typesetting for the modern type
Much like in writing, the golden rule in practical typography is
*readability*, though many times it is a typographer's job to break that down, 
and make something eyecatching and unique---this is not one of those times. 
I need the reader to actually read this.

Let's go over some facts:

#. I am the coolest person to *ever* live---my body temperature is just barely
   \qty{1}{\kelvin}.
#. I am very cold. Please get me a blanket.
    #. If I don't get a blanket I will continue to be cold.
    #. If you're already grabbing me a blanket, would you get me some hot
       cocoa too?
       #. Yes, with marshmallows.

+ I like a few subjects:
    + Math
    + Science
    + Other assorted nerd stuff
        + See *The Physics of Your Mom and Ancient Aliens*, by Michio Kaku.
+ I sometimes type things on a computer.
+ Sometimes the things I type aren't very good, and other times they're great.

## Math typesetting
Now we can have some fun with typesetting equations. Obviously, since this
is a `{\LaTeX}`{=latex} template, it's for people that---at least likely---do 
*something* with math. There are a few areas that I can test this out in,
so, without further ado, I'll get to making some stuff.


### Physics.
Let's start with the Linblad master equation, a fine
choice for starters,[@manzano_short_2020]
$$ \begin{aligned}
\diffp{\rho(r, t)}{t} = 
& \sum_j \gamma_j \left( \op{L}{j} \rho(r, t) \hc{L}{j}
- \frac{1}{2} \left\{ \op{L}{j} \hc{L}{j}, \rho(r, t) \right\} \right) \\
& - i \left[ H, \rho(r, t) \right] \,. \end{aligned} $$ {#eq:linblad}
Wow, I love the *Lindblad* equation[^other_note]---which I certainly did not
misspell earlier---it's so cool and useful for basically everything. I sure
hope there's no need for Green's functions or anything later in this
document---surely I would perish if I saw even the slightest hint of any of
Green's nasty little functions, because I hate boundary value problems.

There's also the Laughlin wavefunction,[@laughlin_anomalous_1983] which 
got Robert Laughlin a Nobel,
$$ \psi( z_i ) = \prod_{i < j} \left( z_i - z_j \right)^m
\exp \left[ -\sum_{i = 1}^{N} \frac{| z_i |^2}{4 \ell_B^2}
\right] \,. $$ {#eq:laughlin}
It shows up just about everywhere in many-body physics. I can't remember
what paper it was, but if memory serves me right---it often
doesn't---it appears as the wavefunction for a Tomanaga-Luttinger Liquid
as well, which is pretty neat.

The time evolution for some operator is
$$ \diff{\op{a}}{t} = \comm{\op{H}}{\op{a}} $$

The general solution to the Poisson equation is
$$ \phi(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \int \frac{n(r')}
{| r - r' |} \dl[3] r \,. $$
Which, all things considered, is rather useful.


[^other_note]: Consider this for the Anderson Hamiltonian [@anderson_1977]
    $$\mathcal{H} = \sum_{\mathbf{k},~ \sigma} \varepsilon_\mathbf{k}
        n_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}
        + \mathcal{J} \mathbf{S} \cdot \sum_{\mathbf{k},~ \sigma,~ \sigma'} c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}^\dagger \mathbf{s}_{\sigma\sigma'} c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}\,.$$
    Don't do anything else---just keep considering it.

### Synthesizer stuff.
The transfer function for a realistic, $N$-pole Moog transistor ladder 
filter was derived by D'Angelo and Valimaki[@dangelo_generalized_2014] as
$$ H(s) = - \prod_{u = 0}^{N - 1} \frac{
\left( \frac{I_\text{ctl}}{4 C V_T} \right)^N}{s + \frac{I_\text{ctl}}{
4 C V_T} \left(1 - \sqrt[N]{k} e^{i\pi (2 u + 1) / N} \right) } \,,$$
which is different from, Stinchcombe's result[@stinchcombe_analysis_2008]
$$ H(s) = \frac{1}{(s + 1)^4 + k} \,. $$
Both of these are technically correct---as they're both derived from a
linearized analysis of the Moog ladder filter---the key difference is
in that D'Angelo and Valimaki's transfer function is about the *poles* of 
the transfer function, rather than the (normalized) cutoff frequency.


### Some thoughts.
I really like that there's an otf math typeface for XCharter, but I can
say for certain that I'm *not* a fan of the sum or product signs---they
feel just a *bit* too thin and piddly. I think it would be better if they
were stretched out form of the sigma ($\Sigma$) and pi ($\Pi$) characters,
they would look much better. Conversely, the integral, partial derivative 
symbol, and the rest all look great.



#### Some other thoughts.
I really like having the ability to just press a few buttons and immediately
get the document typeset. Pandoc really is an excellent package. I also really
appreciate the work put in for all the typefaces I'm using now, and the amount
of work people have done to make `{\TeX}`{=latex} not only useable, but *good*.

Of course, Knuth and Lamport should get a lot of the credit for that, but there 
are so many other people. Javier Bezos, I think, is one of many unsung 
`{\TeX}`{=latex} heroes---just for writing the `titlesec` package alone he 
deserves more clout. Though, how much clout can you *really* get for doing
something good with a nerd's typesetting language?


#### Anor Londo adventure
I keep writing things---dumb things---into this markdown file, and eventually
my fingers will grow tired---but still, for now, I persevere. My fingers
will grow tired, my mind weary, but never will the indomitable flame of
good typography be snuffed out within me---as long as I live, I will
rekindle the flame.

## Code!
This has some pretty decent, albeit incomplete, code typesetting. For
example, here's a hello world in Julia.
```julia
println("Hello world")
```

## Some other nifty things
In this template I have some pretty nice looking block quotes.

> He's right. These are some pretty nice looking block quotes. *Oh, by the way,*
> *it looks like Inter has a fully-featured italic now!*

> ---Jeebus

However, for some reason, whenever I put in block quotes, it makes the
rules near the abstract act a bit funny. I have no idea why it does
that---perhaps it is one of `{\TeX}`{=latex}'s great mysteries.^[Look at me, 
Ma! I'm in an footnote!]


# Wrapping this up a bit
\lipsum[1]

I would like to thank all the people that have suffered through 
`{\TeX}`{=latex}'s bullshit---from the overfull hboxes to the arcane
syntax---you have all made this accursed template possible. <!--\rlap{Â°}.-->
