# Introduction
If you know anything about `\TeX`{=latex}---and since you're a Pandoc user,
you probably do---you know that Computer Modern is the standard font. I have
some enmity with Computer Modern, though---I think that, in the grand scheme
of things, it is often a non-choice. I would be willing to bet that a vast
majority of papers on the arXiv use Computer Modern as their main font, not
because they particularly like it, or that it's always the best tool for the
job, but because it's there from the start. Like the default font in Word or
LibreOffice, you use Computer Modern because you don't particularly care about
what your document looks like, because you're more worried about peer
reviewers tearing your article to shreds than making the document look unique
or pretty.

The thing is, I like Computer Modern despite its flaws. People make a big deal
about how pretty `\LaTeX\:\!`{=latex} output is, and I can't blame them---some
particularly wonderful examples can found in *SIAM Review* articles from the
1980s or so---but it's not always perfect. Once it got converted to
PostScript, Computer Modern became *spindly* and difficult to read on
screens. Thankfully, as of a few years ago, Antonis Tsolomitis began work on
New Computer Modern---one of the greatest features he added is a new
"book" weight which recaptures Computer Modern's old beauty by giving it some
heft.

The `knuth` style is dedicated to giving your documents a *learnded* edge.
Personally, there are times that I just want to use Computer Modern because it
looks nice, and because it's the default style. Likewise, this is a great
style for heavy amounts of mathematical typesetting---New Computer Modern has
loads of features that make mathematics render wonderfully.

Unfortunately, there aren't many weights available in the sans font, so that
keeps me from exercising my normal typesetting panache (or lack thereof).
