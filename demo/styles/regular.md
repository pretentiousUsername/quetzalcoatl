# Introduction
This is the standard. If you're not going to pick anything else, you're
getting this. Don't worry, I don't think you're boring for using this style.
You have three outfits with statement pieces in them, but not this style.
This is jeans, a t-shirt, a flannel, and some sneakers---timeless,
comfortable, and effortless, but not high-fashion. You're not going to be
turning heads, but you're going to be very presentable, affable, and capable
of dealing with most temperatures. It's *Balatro*, a game that always works
when you don't feel like playing anything in particular.

I chose STIX and Inter, because both of them are, to me, the "new" version of 
Times and Helvetica, respectively---they're workhorses, cockroaches that have
survived the decades because they just work. They're not particularly bold 
fonts, but they're quite legible and capable of efficiently delivering text 
to readers. Both fonts are good on screens and in print---even if Inter is,
for all intents and purposes a screen font. (Matthew Butterick, if you're
reading this, please don't sue me for using a screen font.) STIX is good at
both text and math, so it's quite suitable for mathematical and scientific 
documents, but it's no slouch for straight text, neither. Both of these fonts
have a well made italic shape and boldface.

You can certainly let your hair down a little bit with this style, but it's
also not going to be the best for very informal communications. Please don't
make a rave poster or a birthday party invite using this style---do make a
poster for an *underground* rave with this, since it looks like a regular
document and therefore most people won't give it a second thought.
