# Introduction
Sometimes, your regular habits just aren't as fun anymore. Sometimes you need
to trade pepperoni for a white pizza, and sometimes you need to just use
something with some pizzazz. Sometimes, you need to pick a different word to
start your sentences---that happens very frequently. The `utopia` style is
designed just for that---when you need something a bit different.

The primary font in this is Erewhon, which is just a slightly extended version
of Utopia, one of Adobe's original fonts. I *love* this font---I think it
looks brilliant. That said, Erewhon is a highly situational font. I can't use 
this for a lot of everyday stuff, since it's not quite as neutral as STIX,
nor does it have that "math pedigree" from Computer Modern---Erewhon is stuck
playing second fiddle to these two main workhorses. That said, I think
Erewhon needs to be given a fair shake; even if it's not my everyday pick,
it's still a great bit of typography, and I *want* to use it more in my
typesetting.

Erewhon is what Robert Bringhurst might call a "lyrical modernist"
font:[^bringhurst] the italic is *partially* liberated from the roman font,
and it has a sort of humanist feel to it. I have to say, Erewhon is just 
*brimming* with craftsmanship; you can see it in the ligatures and kerning, 
which are far more complete than Computer Modern or STIX. There's a lot to
love here. This is the style I would use when I want to subtly one-up what
I'd already done---Erewhon is a statement piece which appears effortless. It's
not trying to impress you, it simply *is* impressive. All of this is coupled
with Merriweather sans which, while not as robust as Inter, complements
Erewhon far better than I had initially expected.
