# L'introduction
`\lettrine[lines=4]{I}{ndoubetably}`{=latex}, there ſhall come a time in all of our
lives when taſte and sophiſtication muſt reign supreme, when the much more
idle forms of typography muſt give way to claſs and diſtinction.
Ah yes, Garamond, what a beautiful, elegant font---oh, how its form reminds me
of bright summer days long past in this cruel winter of *grotesque* sans
serifs and transitional serif fonts. Unlike those other styles, this one
is cosmopolitan and refined, urbane as they come; it has read *Ulysses* and 
Russell's *Principia Mathematica*, listens to Liszt, and writes poetry.
Truly, no other style set would ever be quite as [cultured][gallery] as this.

# Ok, I don't actually hate you if you like this style
In reality, I actually really like old-styled, humanist typesetting, just like
this.
