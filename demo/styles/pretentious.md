# L'introduction
`\lettrine[lines=4]{I}{ndoubetably}`{=latex}, there ſhall come a time in all of our
lives when taſte and sophiſtication muſt reign supreme, when the much more
idle forms of typography muſt give way to claſs and diſtinction.
Ah yes, Garamond, what a beautiful, elegant font---oh, how its form reminds me
of bright summer days long past in this cruel winter of *grotesque* sans
serifs and transitional serif fonts. Unlike those other styles, this one
is cosmopolitan and refined, urbane as they come---it has read *Ulysses* and 
Russell's *Principia Mathematica*, listened to Liszt, and wrote poetry with
words like "ichor" and "vivacious," and wrote the plot to *Deus Ex: Human
Revolution*. Truly, no other style set would ever be quite as
[cultured][gallery] as this.

## Ok, I don't actually hate you if you like this style
In reality, I love old-styled, humanist typesetting, just like this. 
Aside from looking "sophisticated," styles like this translate to print very
nicely---provided your printer has sufficient DPI---and it does have a certain
*je ne c'est quoi* about it, a certain style that is tantalizing to me. I did
not mean to call this style pretentious to prevent you from using it---if this
is your style, by all means use it---but the style does carry an element of
ostentatiousness about it. The truth is, you *should* use this style.

There are many things which simply look good in Garamond; there are many times
when you simply need something to be Refined and Cultured™. I can't think of
a particular example right now. In any case, if you want to impress a general
audience, you want to give off an air of sophistication, use this. Typesetting
has rhetorical power, whether people know it or not. In that sense, this is
the rhetorical equivalent of a champagne glass---something which practically
*begs* for high-quality contents, but can make apple juice look fancy. (Please
typeset responsibly.)

I would avoid using this style set if your audience has a lot of low
resolution screens or your printer has a low DPI count. Garamond is very
pretty, but the typeface demands high resolution to be readable. Likewise, you
should not hand somebody a paper using this style while wearing a powdered wig
and tights, primarily because you would look very silly while doing so.
