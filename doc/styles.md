| `pretentious` | Cochineal | Ysabeau | ??? | | What, you think you're better than me? Ok, ok, you're not actually pretentious for using this styleset, but keep in mind that humanist fonts are not for the feint of heart—while Computer Modern has a lot of power over people that browse the `arXiv` and know what a TeX is, humanist fonts, like these ones, can easily sway the general public. |
